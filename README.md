# Yokel

*Note that this is a work in progress. It doesn't actually work yet.*

A modern XMPP client For Python 3 and GTK3+.

## Getting started

To build / run from source try `make run`, for more options, `make help`.

## Principles

The following are the guiding principles of Yokel in order of highest to lowest
priority:

  - Security
  - Privacy
  - Forward thinking
  - Beautiful design
  - Touch compatible

Note that backwards compatibility is not one of them. If you don't have a
modern XMPP stack, or your contacts are still on some ancient LibPurple based
client, Yokel is probably not for you.
