# Communiqu√©

A modern instant messaging client written in Rust and GTK3 for services that
support XMPP (Jabber).


**BE ADVISED:** this is mostly just a UI experiment. It's a playground for me to
experiment with Rust, GTK, and various XMPP libraries. It will likely never turn
into a real or usable client.
