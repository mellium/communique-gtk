# Yokel

A modern XMPP client for anywhere that can run Python and GTK3.

## Getting started

To build / run from source try `make run`, for more options, `make help`.

## Principles

The following are the principles of Yokel in order of highest to lowest
priority:

  - Security
	- Privacy
	- Forward thinking
	- Touch compatible
	- Beautiful design

Note that backwards compatibility is not one of them. If you don't have a
modern XMPP stack, Yokel is probably not for you.
