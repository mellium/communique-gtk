# Yokel

A modern XMPP client for anywhere that can run Python and GTK3.

## Getting started

To build / run from source try `make run`, for more options, `make help`.

## Principles

The following are the principles of Yokel in order of highest to lowest
priority:

  - Security
  - Privacy
  - Forward thinking
  - Beautiful design
  - Touch compatible

Note that backwards compatibility is not one of them. If you don't have a
modern XMPP stack, or your contacts are still on some ancient LibPurple based
client, Yokel is probably not for you.
